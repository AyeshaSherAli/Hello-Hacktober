<?php 
echo 'Hello World';

// If you want to print in browser's console
  print_r("Hello World");

// or we can simply print it with print,the difference in print and echo is print has return value 1 and echo does not have return value  

Print "Hello, World!";

we can also print hello world with the help of veriables and var_demp function

$stringVar = 'hello world';
  var_dump($stringVar);
?>
